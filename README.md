# Churn Prediction API

This project is a Flask-based REST API for predicting customer churn risk and churn probability. It uses a pre-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and a Random Forest model to serve predictions. It also stores prediction data in MongoDB.

---

## Features

- Predict churn risk classification (`0` = no churn, `1` = churn)
- Predict churn probability score (0.0 to 1.0)
- Store prediction results and features in MongoDB
- Easy to test via REST endpoints (Postman or curl)
- Load models using TensorFlow/Keras and Joblib

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- MongoDB running locally or accessible remotely
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)
- Pre-trained models (`prediction_model.pkl` and `probability_model.keras`)
